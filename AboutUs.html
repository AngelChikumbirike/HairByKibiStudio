		<h2> Hair by Kibi Studio</h2> 
        <p>Founded in December 2022 by Vimbikai Chikumbirike, also known as Kibi, Hair by Kibi Studio began as a passion project during her gap year. With time on her hands and a desire to learn something new, Kibi decided to explore the world of hairstyling. What started as a personal journey quickly blossomed into something bigger.

            Today, Hair by Kibi Studio has grown into a thriving business, incorporating talented hairstylists who share the same commitment to creativity, quality, and customer care. We specialize in a range of styles, from classic braids to modern, textured looks, offering each client a personalized experience.
            
            At Hair by Kibi Studio, we believe in enhancing natural beauty and celebrating individuality, one hairstyle at a time.</p>
